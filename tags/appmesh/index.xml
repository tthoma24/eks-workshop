Welcome to the Amazon EKS Workshop!
The intent of this workshop is to educate users about the features of Amazon EKS.
Background in EKS, Kubernetes, Docker, and container workflows are not required, but they are recommended.
This chapter will introduce you to the basic workings of Kubernetes, laying the foundation for the hands-on portion of the workshop.
Specifically, we will walk you through the following topics:</description></item><item><title>Start the workshop...</title><link>/020_prerequisites/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/020_prerequisites/</guid><description>Getting Started To start the workshop, follow one of the following depending on whether you are&amp;hellip;

In this module, we will use eksctl to launch and configure our EKS cluster and nodes.</description></item><item><title>Service Mesh with App Mesh</title><link>/advanced/320_servicemesh_with_appmesh/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Aug 2018 08:30:11 -0700</pubDate><guid>/advanced/320_servicemesh_with_appmesh/</guid><description>At re:invent 2018, we announced AWS App Mesh, a service mesh that provides application-level networking to make it easy for your services to communicate with each other across multiple types of compute infrastructure. App Mesh standardizes how your services communicate, giving you end-to-end visibility and ensuring high-availability for your applications.
Service meshes like AWS App Mesh help you to run and monitor HTTP and TCP services at scale. Whether your application consists of AWS Fargate, Amazon EC2, Amazon ECS, Amazon Kubernetes Service, or Kubernetes clusters or instances, App Mesh provides consistent routing and traffic monitoring functionality, giving you insight into problems and the ability to re-route traffic after failures or code changes.</description></item></channel></rss>
