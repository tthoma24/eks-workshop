Welcome to the Amazon EKS Workshop!
The intent of this workshop is to educate users about the features of Amazon EKS.
Background in EKS, Kubernetes, Docker, and container workflows are not required, but they are recommended.
This chapter will introduce you to the basic workings of Kubernetes, laying the foundation for the hands-on portion of the workshop.
Specifically, we will walk you through the following topics:</description></item><item><title>Start the workshop...</title><link>/020_prerequisites/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/020_prerequisites/</guid><description>Getting Started To start the workshop, follow one of the following depending on whether you are&amp;hellip;

In this module, we will use eksctl to launch and configure our EKS cluster and nodes.</description></item><item><title>Machine Learning using Kubeflow</title><link>/advanced/420_kubeflow/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Nov 2019 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>/advanced/420_kubeflow/</guid><description>Machine Learning using Kubeflow Kubeflow provides a simple, portable, and scalable way of running Machine Learning workloads on Kubernetes.
In this module, we will install Kubeflow on Amazon EKS, run a single-node training and inference using TensorFlow, train and deploy model locally and remotely using Fairing, setup Kubeflow pipeline and review how to call AWS managed services such as Sagemaker for training and inference.</description></item></channel></rss>
